<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 140%;">large block of text. You may want to know which color scheme is better. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/498698/white-light-vs-black-dark-backgrounds-health-effects">Here</a> is some discussion about White (Light) vs. Black (Dark) Backgrounds. Most of us feel that dark-on-light is better for our eyes. However, some of us insist on that light-on-dark is less visual fatigue for long time reading. There may be no better way to find the answer than you try it by yourself. There is a very interesting <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/owmyeyes/">site</a> which provides tow modes for us: black-on-white and white-on-black.  They describe white-on-black as "By now you may be seeing the ghosts of previous lines every time your eyes skip to the next line. When you move on to another site, you'll see a lingering image of this web page superimposed over whatever you look at. For many people, it's a dizzying experience." You may find the black-on-white makes you feel much better. Do you think you have got the right answer from this site? No, absolutely no! According to my knowledge, I would rather prefer light-on-dark. <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> scheme is very popular around hackers, I applied solarized to rewrite that page. Please try on this page, and see which is your favorite choice.</span>
